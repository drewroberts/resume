FOr styling, I utilize [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) to quickly edit the format of the document with Utility classes.

## 300 PPI

What does 300 PPI mean?
300 PPI means “300 pixels per inch”. PPI is the measure of the resolution for digital production. You may see DPI be used interchangeably, but there is a difference. Dots Per Inch (DPI) is the measurement used to determine print resolution. Learn more about DPI vs PPI in [this article](https://www.printivity.com/insights/2022/05/26/dpi-vs-ppi/), but you will only need to focus on PPI for the purpose of this article.

What does it mean for your file design? Well, let’s say that you’re designing a file which is 8.5” wide and 11” tall. Since every inch contains 300 pixels, that means that your 8.5”x11” file should be:

2550 pixels wide (300 pixels/inch * 8.5 inches) and
3300 pixels tall (300 pixels/inch * 11 inches)
